ALGORITHM
1. Identify the function f(x)
2. Find points a and b such that a <b where f(a)<0 and f(b)>0
3. Select x0(initial guess) by getting average of a and b
a + b
2
= x0
4. Define function g(x) which is obtained from f(x)=0 such that x=g(x) and
|g
′
(x) < 1|
5. Calculate x1 such that x1 = g(x0) , x2 = g(x1), x3...xn.
6. Repeat the above till
f(xi) − f(xi−1) = 0
.
7. The root will be at xn.
